set the burger icon to display none

when the screen gets down to the chosen size:
display none all of the <li>s in the navbar
float the burger icon to the right and display block it

We use a JS function to add a class to the top-nav bar when the user clicks on the icon. This is done by specifying the class inside of a mediaquery of the correct screen size. This however will not show up as

the important point: class="topnav responsive", is selected in a media query as '.topnav.responsive' with a double point. Thus the burger works by adding this class to the element with the topnav class.

So we write the media query and then add the class when it is clicked and create the class="topnav responsive" class. Similarly if the class is anything but "topnav" (i.e. "topnav responsive" then we change it (back) to topnav)
